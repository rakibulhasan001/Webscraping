While I appreciate the transparency in admiting that the wrong size was sent, the process after to get it corrected is less than expected for good customer service. When a customer purchases something at a great price, they expect to get that item at a great price. And as soon as the same item is back in stock, I expected it immediately to be shipped  to said customer. That is an example of GREAT customer service. I experienced the opposite. Saying I can get a refund (once you verify its still in good condition) and I can keep an eye out for the item is just frustrating and dissapointing on all levels. And to make matters worse I shouldn't have had to ask for this correction and then request that I get the correct item again for the price I paid. It should have been a given.
