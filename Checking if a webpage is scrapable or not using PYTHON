#Before starging webscraping from a webpage, it should be checked if the page is scrapable or not. 
#When you send a GET request to a server (for example, using the requests.get(url) method in Python), 
#the server responds with an HTTP status code to indicate how the request was processed.

#Meaning of HTTP Status Code 200:
#200 - OK: This status code means the server has successfully processed the request and has returned the desired content in the response body. 

#Without a 200 OK response, there may be an issue with the request (e.g., incorrect URL, server error, or permission issues).

#Other Common HTTP Response Codes:
#404 - Not Found: This means the requested resource (webpage) does not exist on the server. 
#      The URL might be incorrect, or the page may have been deleted.
#403 - Forbidden: The server understood the request, but it refuses to authorize it. 
#      This often happens if scraping is blocked by the website or if you don't have the right permissions.
#500 - Internal Server Error: The server encountered an error while processing the request. 
#      This is a server-side issue.
#301 - Moved Permanently: The page has been permanently moved to a new URL. 
#      The server typically provides the new location in the response header.
#302 - Found (Temporary Redirect): requested resource is temporarily located at a different URL.
